    <h2>Davis Centennial Seal</h2>
    <p>“Davis Centennial Seal.” City of Davis, 2021, https://www.cityofdavis.org/city-hall/city-manager-s-office/arts-culture/davis-centennial-seal.</p>

    <p>As we are working with the City of Davis in order to create our capstone project, it is definitely important to analyze the Centennial Seal which is the root of the projects we are creating. Learning more about the seal allows us to learn more about the Davis community. It is interesting seeing how Susan Shelton ended up designing this seal by including themes such as those Aspiration, Community, Cooperation, Leadership, etc, as well as including imagery such as Putah Creek. I'm still not too sure how much I'm going to incorporate from the seal, but I do know that, like the seal, I want to capture some essence of Davis.</p>


    <h2>History & Symbols of Davis</h2>
    <p>"History & Symbols". City of Davis, n.d., https://www.cityofdavis.org/about-davis/history-symbols</p>
   
    <p>I think this website is important as it gives a bit more insight into the history of Davis and aknowledges that the city of Davis sits on land where Patwin Native Americans originally resided. It is sad to learn that disease had affected most of the Patwins that were left in the 1830's. It also mentions UC Davis and highlights the City of Davis as a university-oriented city. At the end of this article there are three symbols which I didn't really know of.</p>

    <h2>UC Davis Arboretum and Public Garden</h2>
    <p>"UC Davis Arboretum and Public Garden". The Regents of the University of California, Davis, n.d., https://arboretum.ucdavis.edu/</p>
   
    <p>I am trying to highlight and incorprate aspects of the Davis Arboretum and Public Garden. It's a space that is very meaningful to me as my sister who is alumni took me to the arboretum when I was visiting her and Davis. Now, I like to commute through the arboretum admiring the diverse flora and fauna here. I think this website is relevant as it gives informational resources regarding all things related to the Arboretum such as events and different ways to get involved.</p>
