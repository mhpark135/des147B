    <!-- <p>When looking at the seal the first thing that stood out to me was its size. I thought it would be the size of a manhole cover, but it was bigger. The detail and pictographic accuracy really captured scenes in Davis. My personal favorite part was the larger section with the ducks in the arboretum: I've been going to the arboretum more so seeing these ducks was cool.</p> -->
