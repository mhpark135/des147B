    <h1>Storyboard</h1>
    <p>The storyboard was really helpful as it gave me a clearer ethos as to how or why this project could be useful. In all honesty, I think seeing the narrative and realisim through the storyboard allowed me to feel more inspired and dedicted to the project. After sharing our storyboard we also received great feedback and thought of ways to make the project more interactive. For example, instead of it being a single game at the centennial seal, having several version of the game at other famous parts of Davis, such as UC Davis campus or the arboretum.</p>
