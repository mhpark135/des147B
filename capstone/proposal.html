    <h1>Project Proposal</h1>

    <p>My topic revolves around showcasing a part of the arboretum that many students, including myself, use daily! This part of the arboretum is almost like a backroad, leading from Richards all the way to campus. It is a really beautiful walk/bike ride as it follows Putah Creek and showcases so much flora and fauna, including cute ducks and vibrant flowers.</p>

    <p>Maybe I do work with a partner. I still have’t really seen who else is interested or would want to work on the same project. I’d still be willing to work on it alone! I imagine my product to basically be a horizontal, 2d journey that follows a little character through the arboretum from home to campus. Another idea, if the previous one is too complicated, is to create a game based off the google dinosaur game (the one you play without internet), but it is using elements from the arboretum.</p>
        
    <p>Lastly, I am not too sure about how mapping out the arboretum in a graphic sense would look like. I’m not sure if I’d want it to be like an 8bit game, or something closer to a hand-drawn or picturesque style. I’ll see how to do these things and look to further iterate upon my idea.</p>
